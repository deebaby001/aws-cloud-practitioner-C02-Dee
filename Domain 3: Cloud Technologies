Networking:

What is a VPC in AWS, and why is it important? VPC, a Virtual Private Cloud that is  a main component in of cloud computing
What is a subnet, and how is it used in a VPC?  Subnets are a range of IP addresses within a VPC. Subnets are within VPCs to group subnets together
What is an Internet Gateway, and what role does it play in a VPC? acts as a bridge between a Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) and the public internet, allowing network traffic to pass between the two.
What is a NAT Gateway, and why would you use it in a VPC? A Network Address Translation (NAT) gateway is a managed service from Amazon Web Services (AWS) that allows instances in a private subnet to connect to the internet and other services outside of a virtual private cloud (VPC)
What is a Route Table, and how does it function in a VPC? Route table is a set of rules, known as routes, that determines where network traffic is directed. Each subnet in your AWS Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) is associated with a route table that controls the traffic flow between subnets
What is a VPC Peering Connection, and what are its use cases? VPC peering connection in Amazon Web Services (AWS) is a networking connection allowing private routing of traffic between two or more virtual private clouds (VPCs). This allows resources in peered VPCs to communicate with each other as if they were on the same network. 
What is a Security Group, and how does it enhance security in a VPC?  Security group is a virtual firewall that controls network traffic to and from Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud EC2 instances and other VPC resources. Security groups are a key part of AWS cloud security and help to manage resource access.
What is a Network ACL (Access Control List), and how does it differ from a Security Group? The packet must be on the list in order for it to be approved. List checked in and out. They differ in scope, state, default rules, IP blocking, Rule modifications, Associations
How do you use Network ACLs to enhance security within a VPC? Network ACL acts as a firewall adding extra security by improving security: custom ACL’s, denying specific traffic segment the VPC, uses rules for DDoS attacks, monitor traffic
What is an Elastic IP Address, and how is it used in a VPC? An Elastic IP (EIP) is a static public IP address used in Amazon's Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) to enable communication with the internet. EIPs are designed for the dynamic nature of cloud computing, allowing users to remap the address to a different instance in their VPC if one fails.
What is a Virtual Private Gateway, and how does it function in a VPC? A Virtual Private Gateway (VGW) acts as a VPN endpoint for a Site-to-Site VPN connection on the Amazon side. It's a distributed edge routing function that's located at the edge of a VPC and can terminate VPN connections from on-premises or customer environments. Allows for: connectivity, route creation, VPN concentrator, attachment, compatibillity
What is Amazon Route 53, and what are its primary functions? Amazon Route 53, you can create and manage your public DNS records. Route 53 connects user requests to internet applications running on AWS or on-premises
What is the purpose of DNS in the context of Route 53? It translates human-readable domain names into numerical IP addresses that computers use to connect.
How does Route 53 provide high availability and reliability for DNS queries?  This occurs through global network, anycast routing, shuffle sharding, health checks, DNS failover, latency-based routing
What is geolocation routing in Route 53, and what are its benefits? directs traffic to specific resources based on a user's location. It benefits the customers when connecting to a business
What is Amazon CloudFront, and what are its primary functions?
What are the benefits of using Amazon CloudFront? AWS CloudFront a content delivery network (CDN) that improves the distribution of web content to users globally. It uses a network of edge locations and regional edge caches to store copies of content close to viewers, ensuring requests are served from the closest location.
What is AWS Global Accelerator, and what is its purpose?  This  is a network layer service that helps improve the performance, security, and availability of applications for local and global users. It uses the AWS global network to route traffic to the closest healthy application endpoint in the same AWS Region as the user
What is the difference between Amazon CloudFront and AWS Global Accelerator? They are both AWS services that use edge locations worldwide to improve application performance. However, they operate at different layers and have different views: CloudFront (Layer7) and Global Accelerator (Layer4)
What is edge location in the context of Amazon CloudFront? A data center that’s part of a global network that delivers content.
What is AWS Direct Connect, and what are its primary benefits? Improved performance, reduced networking costs, data protection and connectivity across regions.
What are common use cases for AWS Direct Connect? Improved performance, reduced networking costs, data protection and connectivity across regions.

What is AWS VPN, and how does it differ from AWS Direct Connect? Both options for connecting on-premises infrastructure to the Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (VPC). The main difference is that Direct Connect bypasses the public internet for a dedicated connection, while VPN uses the public internet to create an encrypted connection.
What types of AWS VPN connections are available? Direct Connect provides a dedicated, high-bandwidth connection using fiber-optic cable, ranging from 1–100 Gbps. 
What is a Transit Gateway, and how does it benefit network connectivity? connects multiple VPCs through a single gateway, simplifying connectivity and enabling centralized network management
Storage:

What is object storage typically used for in cloud computing? is a cloud computing storage architecture that excels at handling large amounts of unstructured data, like videos, social media content, and sensor data. It's often the preferred method for storing backups, static content, and data archives.
How does Amazon S3 handle durability and availability for object storage? S3 stores data redundantly across a minimum of 3 Availability Zones by default,
What are some typical use cases for Amazon S3? Durabilty and storage
What is the main difference between Amazon S3 Standard and Amazon S3 Standard-IA storage classes?  Main difference is for data that's accessed less often but needs to be available quickly when needed. S3 has lower storage price but higher retravel price.
What is the Amazon S3 Glacier storage class used for? Provides data archiving
How does Amazon S3 Intelligent-Tiering work, and what are its benefits? It stores objects in three access tiers: one tier optimized for frequent access, a lower-cost tier optimized for infrequent access, and a very-low-cost tier optimized for rarely accessed data.
Explain the use case for Amazon S3 One Zone-IA. It stores data in a single AZ and costs 20% less than S3 Standard-IA.
What is Amazon Elastic Block Store (Amazon EBS) and what are its primary use cases? It allows you to create storage volumes and attach them to Amazon EC2 instances
What are the main types of EBS volumes and their characteristics? SSd Optimized for transactional workloads with frequent read/write operations and small I/O size. IOPS (input/output operations per second) measures performance, HDD-Designed for large sequential workloads where throughput is more important. MiB/s measures performance 
What is the difference between Amazon EBS and instance store? Durabilty, performance and use
What are some common use cases for instance store volumes? Faster performance,  and better workload
Can you attach an EBS volume to multiple EC2 instances at the same time? Yesup to 16 instances at the same time.
What is the maximum size of a single Amazon EBS volume? 64TiB
How do you ensure the durability of data stored in Amazon EBS?Users have to create regular snapshots to back up. 99.8-99.9 durability
What is Amazon EBS Snapshots and how are they used? It is a point-in-time copy of your data, and can be used to enable disaster recovery, migrate data across regions and accounts, and improve backup compliance
Can you change the volume type of an existing Amazon EBS volume? Yes
